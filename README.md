Important: you might need to create a free account to access the assets and measures.

Follow these rules:
- Use semantic HTML5 for the content.
- Do not use any frameworks or libraries for neither the CSS3 or JavaScript.
- Use SASS (using the SCSS syntax) for styling the webpage and make sure to upload the SCSS files to the repository too, not just the compiled CSS.
- Make sure the web page works in all browsers down to Internet Explorer 11.
- The max container width should be 1286px.
- Use the Graphik font attached to this email.
- Briefly explain on the README the tools you used and anything else you might consider that requires clarification (syntax choices, CSS naming conventions, etc.).
